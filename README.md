## Difficulties
Some of the difficulties that I faced with this challenge was the switch statement, mainly just forgetting certain things and going through it with a fine toothcomb like a return and forgetting to call the render(), but then I decided that I wanted the file name to be what the letters were that you entered for the filename, and that was a bit difficult because I was calling .render() in the switch statement it wasn't allowing it to be used as a shape.name and so I had to call it after with shape.render(); in the writeFile statement. 

## Sucesses:
I had a lot of sucesses with this making the classes was so fun to me, and the switch statement which has got to be my favourite statement to do, and getting used to things like exporting and importanting functions.

## What I Learned:
I learned how svg is made, and working with classes, and doing validate in the inquierer input.
