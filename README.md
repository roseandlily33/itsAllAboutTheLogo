## Difficulties
Some of the difficulties that I faced with this challenge was the switch statement, mainly just forgetting certain things and going through it with a fine toothcomb like a return and forgetting to call the render(). Also for some reason my examples file wasn't pushing to the github repo until I added it under lib

## Sucesses:
I had a lot of sucesses with this making the classes was so fun to me, and the switch statement. I was able to do and figure out so much on my own with the exception of figuring out how to save the file with a different file name in the examples, and I tried so many things and it would not take. 

## What I Learned:
I learned how svg is made, and working with classes, and doing validate in the inquierer input.
